# Who am I
Hi, my name is Lukas, 24 years old and at the time of writing I am a CS masters student. I want to start this blog to share my enthusiuasm for various diy projects (though most of them probably will evolve around 3d printing or homelabing).
Maybe once or twice there will also be a little coding (maybe microcontroller based stuff, though I am not very expierenced with that). Mostly I see this as an opportunity to learn myself and share what I do for fun. 

# What to expect
As mentioned previously I want this to be about all of my little (or big) projects. To start with I have planned to write a post about my "own" backlight solution that's based around a Raspberry Pi Zero. A big part will be 3d printing and many things to do with it (currently I am experimenting with Klipper and trying to figure out a way to build an enclosure that satisfies me and my "air quality needs"). 

Sometimes I'll also post about a few projects I want to start/need to work on that require a bit of development, but that will be less frequent than the 3d printing/diy stuff. 

Please note that I am in no regards a professional or anything near it when it comes to 3d printing, diying, electronics and so on, I am just trying to figure it out for my self and maybe document the process so somebody can draw inspiration from it. 

# Thanks 
Thanks for reading this first post and stay tuned for more.
